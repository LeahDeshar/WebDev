          Many people are mistaken in thinking that travel photography is just
          about traveling and making photos. While, although that sounds like a
          dream job, not many people will pay you to just travel and take nice
          looking photos. Like any job, travel photography is work – and
          usually, it’s very demanding.

          Yes, you get to go to amazing places, meet exciting people, and the
          world is your office. But, it also has many downsides: sleeping in
          flea-infested guesthouses, never-ending bus rides from hell,
          harassment from corrupted policemen, loneliness, and lack of job
          stability to name a few.

        <p>
          Are you still here? Good! Let’s talk about how to become a travel
          photographer. There are two ways to approach this: finding a client,
          or finding a job that allows you travel.

          <h1>Find Your Client</h1>
          <p>
            As a travel photographer, you have many potential clients. Here I
            will discuss the most common: Governmental tourism organizations,
            NGOs, Commercial organizations and Media.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many governments strive to promote tourism in their countries. To do
            so, they need photographs to show the things and activities tourists
            can see and do in their country. Budget-wise, they have usually deep
            pockets.

          <h2>SECOND OPTION</h2>
          <h1>Commercial Organizations</h1>
          <p>
            As traveling for free and shooting tourist destinations is a dream
            job for almost anyone, the fees offered for the job can be quite
            low. It’s common the photographer only gets paid with benefits like
            free flights or accommodation.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="siTwo">
          <p>
            If you are a top notch, worldwide known photographer, it is very
            likely that customers from all over the world will want to use your
            services (for fashion, events, sports, architecture, products etc.).
            But as we are focusing on travel photography, commercial
            organizations that deal with traveling and tourism are more likely
            to hire you. Notable examples are hotels, tour companies, airlines
            and so on.

          <h1>Is Travel Photography for You?</h1>
          <p>
            Is your nine-to-five desk job boring you? Do you hate reporting to a
            boss? Is Peter in accounting really grinding your gears? It is a
            dream of many to leave their day jobs and get paid to travel the
            world, but is it really thateasy? With a little bit of planning and
            the mindset of an entrepreneur, you too can make travel photography
            a viable lifestyle. However, there are a couple of things you must
            realize right off the bat.
